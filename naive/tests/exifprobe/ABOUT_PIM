Beginning with version 1.2.6, exifprobe reports the structure of
Print Image Matching sections, according to information provided by
evan@ozhiker.com on the web page at

http://www.ozhiker.com/electronics/pjmt/jpeg_info/pim.html

The meaning of the PIM tags and the interpretation of the 4 bytes
of data in each entry are not known. Exifprobe prints the tags by
hexadecimal number, and prints the data in two formats: a "hex dump"
of each data entry, followed by the hex and decimal values of the data
interpreted as unsigned long integers in the prevailing byteorder of the
Exif data.

Print IM is a feature of Epson Printers, supported by several camera
manufacturers. The PrintIM section is included in either the first TIFF
IFD or in the MakerNote, or both. The section records a "profile"
indicating certain transformations which the manufacturer finds will
improve the image presentation on a PrintIM-enabled printer. Epson
provides a FAQ at

http://www.printimagematching.com/faq4.php

which better describes Print Image Matching.

According to the FAQ, the values provided in the PrintIM section may
include:
    Gamma Level
    Color Space
    Color Balance
    Contrast
    Brightness
    Sharpness
    Saturation
