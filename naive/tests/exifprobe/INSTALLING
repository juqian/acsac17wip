The program should compile on any reasonably modern Unix or Linux
system, but has been tested only on FreeBSD and RedHat Linux. No
extra libraries are required.  If you compile on other systems,
please let me know.  I have deliberately attempted to avoid the
need for massive "autoconfuse" scripts, but time will tell.

For FreeBSD and Linux, it should be sufficient to just type 'make'
unless you wish to change defaults for CFLAGS (see below). On
some systems you may need 'gmake' (or edit the PREFIX line to
something your make will accept).

If your system does not have a system include file "endian.h"
which defines BYTE_ORDER (or __BYTE_ORDER) as LITTLE-something or
BIG-something, you may need to fix the file "makebyteorder.sh",
or manually create a file "byteorder.h" in the distribution 
directory.  If your machine's native byte order is big-endian,
add the single line:

#define NATIVE_BYTEORDER_BIGENDIAN

The sources assume little-endian unless told otherwise,
so an empty "byteorder.h" is sufficient in that case.

Check CFLAGS:
    If your system includes provide the type 'uint32_t' in types.h
    but not 'u_int32_t' (Solaris), uncomment the line which defines
    uint32_t (or add the definition to CFLAGS). BSD and Linux define
    u_int32_t in sys/types.h, which is where this code expects it.

    If you do NOT want support for ANSI color sequences to emphasize
    certain sections of the output, remove
        -DCOLOR
    Alternatively, if you want color but find my selections bilious,
    you can change a few defines in defs.h.  The colors currently
    used are intended to be used with a light background; I don't
    recommend them with 'reverse-video' or otherwise dark backgrounds.

    If you want color compiled in, but don't want it by default (the
    '-c' flag toggles color if support is compiled in) edit defs.h to
    remove the PRINT_COLOR bit from PRINT_DEFAULTS.

Check PREFIX, BINDIR and MANDIR: set to the directories where the executable
    and manual page should be copied.  Normally, you will only need to set
    PREFIX.

Then do
    (optional) make depend (requires the executable 'makedepend')
    make 

and when you're ready
    make install

The files in the 'aux" directory must be compiled and/or installed
manually.  There is a simple Makefile for the C programs.  You may
want to modify the scripts for your own purposes.
