These programs are rather crude but may be useful.

extract_section - extracts a section of a file given start offset
                  and length, or start and end offset (which you
                  can get from exifprobe output). An easy way to
                  extract embedded JPEGs.

findjpeg        - scan a file for valid jpeg streams. VERY crude,
                  and not useful on mostly binary files.

dump_section    - print a specified chunk of a file as bytes,
                  shorts, longs, or short or long rationals.

probetohtml     - a simple shell script which uses 'sed' to convert
                  color escape sequences to font color tags and
                  generate an HTML file for the output of exifprobe.

reformat.sh     - script to reformat LIST output to change dots to
                  underscores, remove comments, etc. to make the
                  output acceptable to a shell for sourcine. The
                  '-var' and '-export' options of exifgrep are no
                  longer adequate for that purpose.

convert_rgb_to_tiff -  convert the RGB section of a Canon CR2 file to
                       a 384x256 TIFF image that anybody can see.
                       Uses ImageMagick 'convert' utility.

convert_rgb_to_jpeg -  convert the RGB section of a Canon CR2 file to
                       a 384x256 JPEG image that anybody can see.
                       Uses ImageMagick 'convert' utility.
