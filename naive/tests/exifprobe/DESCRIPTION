Exifprobe reads image files produced by digital cameras (including
several so-called "raw" file formats) and reports the structure of
the files and the auxilliary data and metadata contained within them.
In addition to TIFF, JPEG, and EXIF, the program understands several
formats which may contain "raw" camera data, including MRW, CIFF/CRW,
JP2/JPEG2000, RAF, and X3F, as well as most most TIFF-derived "raw"
formats, including DNG, ORF, CR2, NEF, K25/KDC/DCR, and PEF.

MakerNote sections found in Exif IFDs are reported and expanded if the  
note is in a semblance of TIFF IFD format. Information which has been   
published on the internet is used to interpret notes where possible.    

The default output attempts to describe the structure of the file,      
showing location, size and content of auxilliary data, metadata, and    
image sections. Multiple images contained in a single file are noted    
(and JPEG sub-image markers examined for useful data). A summary of     
images found is printed at the end of output for each file.

Many options are provided for detail control of output format.          
For convenience, two pre-set formats (in addition to the default        
'structural' format) are provided: a "report" format (which shows       
"structure" of TIFF ifds, but with values printed inline), and a        
"list" format which eliminates structural elements and presents data    
in a human (or script) readable format for possible use in gallery      
applications.
